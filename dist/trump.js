Just more very dishonest media!',"I will build a great wall - and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me - and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.","When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending the best.
